## Introduction

### Game Summary

Guardiens of Gua is a game only controlled with one button. You protect your plants from hungry bugs with a vicious force field.

### Inspiration

Our game is inspired by tower defense games such as Dome Keeper.

### Player Experience

It will be a challenge, but with a light-hearted tone.

### Platform

Web-based, any pc

### Development Software

raylib, maybe more?

### Genre

tower defense

### Target Audience

Casual gamers


## Concept

### Gameplay Overview

You can shrink and grow your force field to kill the bugs. With time more bugs will spawn and you will have to defend more plants.

### Theme Interpretation (Dome, Agreement, Bug)

We chose to focus on the keywords Dome and Bug. That can be seen by the force field dome and the bug enemies.

### Primary Mechanics

1. The Force Field kills bugs, and can change it's size
2. Bugs can destroy your plants, which leads to game over

### Secondary Mechanics

1. Over time more plants will grow
2. There will be different kinds of bugs


## Art

### Theme Interpretation

We will have bugs and a dome.

### Design

Lots of

## Audio

day night cicle
advanced input handling -> tapping
hard mode -> smaller dome, more tapping, STEPS as a var
enemy animations

### Notes

To plants spawning: The plants are constructed out of hollow Rectangles. The first plant has the power of reproduction, by filling itself out (with color). When she is full a new offspring will be spawned and there small chance that it too can reproduce.
